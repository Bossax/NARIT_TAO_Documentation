NARIT TAO Documentation
=====
This documentation provide an overview and details of a software architecure of
 Toolkit for Adaptive Optics systems (TAO) in NARIT's context.

### **For an overview of TAO** -> [TAO overview](./TAO.md)

 ### List of cameras
 1. [Nuvu camera](./Nuvu.md)
 2. [Grasshopper camera (Spinnaker)](./Grasshopper.md)
 3. [FLI camera](./FLI.md)


[TAO_NARIT](https://github.com/Bossax/TAO_NARIT)
--
This repository provides examples of cameras' APIs and how to wrap them with TAO architecture of devices in AO bench (Nuvu and Grasshopper).
This repository also contains source code of Nuvu GUI program.

[NARIT_HDC](https://github.com/Bossax/NARIT_HDC)
--
This repository provides examples of a BMC Deformable Mirror and an FLI camera in the EvWaCo testbed bench.

[SpinnakerCameras.jl](https://github.com/Bossax/SpinnakerCameras.jl)
--
This repository aims to provide a user-friendly interface to control a Grasshopper camera in *Julia langauge*.

[Phase plate](./PhasePlate.md)
--
Explain how to wrap Lexitek APIs with MATLAB and compose mex files. Basic workflow.


--------
Manuals of most AO-related devices can be found in NextCloud
EvWaCo prototype > Adaptive Optics > Manuals

Some SDKs are available online. Some are sent privately in emails.
